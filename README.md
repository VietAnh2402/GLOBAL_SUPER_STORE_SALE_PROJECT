1 Overview Description: Performance KPIs increase 24-27% YoY, in case return rate is low and tend to reduce
-> It is the righ time to reinvest and start expand in other market and reform strategic product

2 The sale amount need to emphasize is Jun and 5 months end of the year in 4 year are in the same trend
-> can see the seasonal and cycle sale here  -> Can have marketing campagin in peak time to increase brand awareness and sale amount.

3 Return rate is low 5% 
-> service is good and products are fit with customer needs
-> To remain cost, company need to keep it low but if it increase to average industry is also fine when sale amount increase
, because the present strategy is promote sale to gain marketshare

4 Order amount and Discount are correlrated significantly 
-> We can base on this and give more personalize discount to loyal customer and new customer to increase retention rate

5 Break down by Country:
As we can see USA is main area ($734k) which has sale amount is double with second and third market. 
Beside US, Australia ($324k), China ($218k)and India ($205k) in APAC market 
Next to it is Europe (France, UK, Italya, Germany) where has advantage is a lot of import and export events with US 
In the same America Continent, country also have high sale amount is Mexico and Brazil
-> US is still an importance market and need to remain the growth momentum  
-> We are having 2 potential market to expand and gain market share

6 The reason make sale amount in Jun increase is sale amount of Aus, Ger, UK, 
and whole countries also have high sale amount in 4 month of the years 

7 Overview shipping time and shipping type which is also importance when we are a global company. 
Normally customers choose standard ship with avg shipping time is 5 days and cost $40, 
in US avg shipping cost is $33 is less than 17% with avg
-> We can add more warehouse in EU and APAC to reduce shipping cost and reduce lead time to make it more effective.
 It is also a way to increase sale amount in EU and APAC when the shipping fee is low.

8 Number of customer slowly grow justs 3% per year, even the sale increase 25%.
 It is both strength and weakness of the company. Because retention rate is good 
but we do'nt have many new customers
-> To expand in other market, we need to put more effort to marketing strategy to attract more new customers.

9 80% customer is Consumer and Corporate, have both B2C and B2B customer
-> Choose platform to marketing such as with B2B we must use website to build trust and credit,
 it also a common platform to build many strategy with B2C: Loyalty score, marketing message.

10 With target expand markets cover 90% Sale 

11 Bucket amount is quite high with normal consumer average 500$. The reason can be is shipping fee high and products which were 
bought also expensive and each order have many items average 7 items each buy. 
-> Placing more warehouses is a good choice right now. 

12 Overview total sale of three categories is quite the same. Technology always keep highest sale amount 
but not too much, expect June and October
-> It is a good time to have big campaign. But we need to deeply analyst into each market. Because customers 
in different market have other purchasing habit.

13 To find out strategic product to extend marketshare, we need to pay attention to products in US market: 
Total sale in 3 cat also the same,
The total number of orders in Office Supplies is highest 53%: Binders and Storage were bought the most.
The characteristic in Office Supplies products is can be bought together and cheaper than products in other categories. 
Profit margin in these product is really good avg from 15-25% a product expect some products sale for liquidity. 
The product represents for Technology (50% sales amount and 50% orders) is Phone that most of them were sold for consumers.
Before 2014, sale amount of Furniture is higher than Office Supplier but after that it is lower than Office Supplier, 
and Profit margin also is  is not too good with many product have to sale for liquidity.
-> Marketing and website displays should forcus on phone cus these products always follow on trend and replace yearly
Office Supplier combo with sale season follow the peak time, and can add monthly subcribe
-> Interm of characteristic of Furniture with high shipping fee, waste warehouse facilities, company need to 
reduce product with low pro fit margin and low sale amount.
